        <p> Searching for improvement has been always a necessity in my life. I've always been curious about how human brain works and its capacity of resiliency, flexibility and adaptation.Â 

            My biggest learning opportunity came when I decided to move alone to Lisbon in 2018 without knowing language or culture. 
            
            After all this years of growth, learning portuguese and improving my english skills, I discovered UX field and get passionate about it.
            With audiovisual and entrepreneur background I found in UX field the perfect profession to develop my full potencial.</p>
